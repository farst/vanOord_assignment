# MAGIC # Data Pipeline Demo: CSV to Parquet to Delta Lake (Catalog Fixed)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook demonstrates:
# MAGIC 1. Reading CSV data from storage
# MAGIC 2. Data cleaning and transformation
# MAGIC 3. Writing to Parquet format using Unity Catalog
# MAGIC 4. Converting to Delta Lake with versioning
# MAGIC 5. Time travel and audit capabilities
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note**: This version uses the correct catalog that exists in your Unity Catalog setup.
