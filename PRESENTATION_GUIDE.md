## 🎬 **Your Presentation (45 minutes)**

### **1. Opening (5 minutes)**
*"I've built a complete enterprise Databricks platform. Let me show you what's been implemented."*

**Show:**
- **Workspace**: https://adb-734420944977024.4.azuredatabricks.net
- **Storage**: voodatabricks77284 (ADLS Gen2)
- **SQL Warehouse**: demo-sql-warehouse

### **2. Live Demo (15 minutes)**
*"Now I'll demonstrate Infrastructure as Code by modifying our production SQL warehouse."*

**Commands:**
```bash
cd /Users/faust/Documents/GitHub/vanOord_assignment/databricks_setup

# Show current size
terraform output sql_warehouse_cluster_size
# Result: "2X-Small"

# Plan the change
terraform plan -var="sql_warehouse_cluster_size=Large"

# Apply the change
terraform apply -var="sql_warehouse_cluster_size=Large" -auto-approve

# Verify the change
terraform output sql_warehouse_cluster_size
# Result: "Large"
```

**Show in Databricks UI**: Refresh SQL Warehouses page to see the change.

### **3. Technical Answers (15 minutes)**
*"I've implemented comprehensive answers to all 9 technical questions."*

**Show:**
- Open `ASSIGNMENT_ANSWERS.md`
- Highlight key sections with code examples
- Show working notebooks in `notebooks/` folder

### **4. Power BI Assessment (10 minutes)**
*"I've designed a complete self-service Power BI solution for 5 departments."*

**Key Points:**
- **Departments**: Data Platform, Analytics Engineers, Data Governance, SMD, E&E
- **Security**: Unity Catalog with row-level security
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for each department
- **Implementation**: 16-week phased approach
